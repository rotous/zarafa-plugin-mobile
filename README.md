# Mobile Plugin for the Zarafa WebApp

## Goal
The main goal of the plugin is to make the Zarafa WebApp responsive so it will be possible to use it on mobile devices.

It will be developed in steps:
- First it should be possible to read e-mail messages in the Inbox folder on mobile devices
- Then it should be possible to read e-mail messages in other e-mail folders
- Then it should be possible to write new e-mail messages
- Then I will look into possibilities to get the calendar working
